# PTNet
We provide the source code of paper *In Silico Model for miRNA-medicated Regulatory Network in Cancer* for Nucleic Acids Research submission.

## Goal
 - PTNet is a graph-based learning model which simulates the miRNAs (microRNAs) that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally *in silico*.
 - Our model estimates the protein levels by considering the miRNA-mRNA interaction network, the mRNA expression and the miRNA expression.
